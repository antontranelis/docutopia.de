# Map Components
Map UI is a JavaScript Library to create nice and easy to use Map Apps and it's the crystallization point of Utopia OS where everything comes together.

It's made with [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) and has ...

* **Map** (based on OpenStreetMap)

* **Layers** (places, events, profiles, offers, needs)

* **Items with Markers** (customizable in shape, color and icon)

* **Popups** (to view and create new items)

... availible as React Components

### Getting Started

```
 npm install utopia-ui
```

then import in your React App
